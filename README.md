   http://localhost/phpmyadmin
   ```

3. Look at the **Server version** (top-right corner):
   - If **MariaDB is 10.4 or below**, update to the latest version from [MariaDB official site](https://mariadb.org/download/).

## 3. Set Up the Virtual Environment

1. In the VS Code terminal, activate the virtual environment using Pipenv:

   ```sh
   pipenv shell
   ```

   - If Pipenv is not installed, install it first:

     ```sh
     pip install pipenv
     ```

   ```sh
   cd task_manager
   ```

## 4. Run the Django Development Server

1. Inside the **pipenv shell**, run the following command to start the server:

   ```sh
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

2. If everything is set up correctly, the terminal will show that the server is running.

   ```

2. You should see the Django **task manager** application running.

## 6. Additional Notes

- If you get a **database connection error**, check your database credentials in `settings.py` to ensure they match **phpMyAdmin**.
- If migrations are missing, run:

  ```sh
  python manage.py migrate
  ```
